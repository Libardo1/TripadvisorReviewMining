TripadvisorReviewMining
=======================

An analysis of reviews collected on Tripadvisor.com for a Hotel, figuring out what the customers are saying about the hotel, and seeing if the negative reviews shed light on anything specific

The repository contains R code for extracting data for the specified hotel and doing sentiment analysis on the reviews written by the customers.

Apologies in advance for not keeping the code and repo clean, but if you know R you can figure things out very easily. To re-run the code you will not need any major changes

The filenames of the codes are self explainatory.

This is just an initial work and will be very happy to collaborate on this.
Let me know in case of any suggestions/comments/modifications etc.

Cheers !
